                <h3>Personalised tutoring</h3>
                <p>
                    Your needs and struggles are unique to you, so the tutoring you receive should accommodate for this.
Is there a question that is stumping you? A concept that you canâ€™t get your head around? An upcoming test that is stressing you out? Get in touch and I can help you figure it out.

                <h3>Exam preparation</h3>
                <p>
                    It is normal to worry about exams, but with some preparation you can make sure that you are ready for them.
I am available to go through past papers with you, mark questions, provide feedback, or create some questions of my own in the areas that you are struggling in to help you stay on track.

                <p>
                    I am based in North Ayrshire and am able to travel to meet you for a session.
Have you got a local library, community centre, cafe, etc. in mind? Let me know and we can figure something out.

                <p>
                    Would you prefer an online session, over Zoom, Microsoft Teams, or Google Meet? That can be arranged too.
Let me know what suits you best, and relevant arrangements can be made.
