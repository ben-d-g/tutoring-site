                <h2>Why me?</h2>
                <p>I graduated from the University of St Andrews with a master’s degree in maths. During this time I also took classes in computer science. As well as this, I have National 5, Higher, and Advanced Higher qualifications in both of these subjects, so am familiar with the content of these courses and will be happy to share this with you.</p>
